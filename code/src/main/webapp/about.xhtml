					<h3>We have the great team</h3>
					<img alt="" src="static/image/13.jpg" />Ever wished you could revisit
					your college days? But can’t find the right way to do it? We are
					here to take you to your sweet memories by photo printing. Coombu
					is designed with students for students. Coombu is a cool way to
					convert your college memories into a beautiful photo year book that
					you can cherish for life! Coombu web application(www.coombu.com)
					and mobile applications(Android and iOS) will allow students to
					login to a particular group, upload and view photos, add a story
					punch-line to the uploaded photos, voting of published photos by
					easy likes, adding comments to the published photos.
					<h3>Planning</h3>
					<img alt="" src="static/image/16.jpg" />When deciding where to travel,
					we had to take many aspects into consideration. To agree on a
					destination wasn’t easy, and we had many discussions concerning
					this. When 17 people are travelling together, chances are pretty
					high that not everyone will agree. Democratic votes were held, and
					the majority got their will. China seemed rather exotic and
					suitable for most of us, and no one in the group had ever been
					there before. After agreeing on China, we decided the two main
					“bases”: Shanghai and Beijing. Shanghai is known to be representing
					the modern and technological part of China, while Beijing’s main
					focus lies in presenting Chinese history and traditions. The
					planning process could begin!
