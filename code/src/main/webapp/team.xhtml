					<h3>TEAM 1</h3>
					<img alt="" src="static/image/team1.jpg" />We are a group of 17
					Norwegian students, who in the period 18th of February till 1st of
					March 2008, went on a trip to China. More specifically, we visited
					Shanghai and Beijing. On this site we will present various things
					that can be good to know before travelling to China, both in a
					group or by yourself. We will also try to give you a decent
					presentation of the trip that we have made.
					<h3>TEAM 2</h3>
					<img alt="" src="static/image/team2.jpg" />When deciding where to
					travel, we had to take many aspects into consideration. To agree on
					a destination wasn’t easy, and we had many discussions concerning
					this. When 17 people are travelling together, chances are pretty
					high that not everyone will agree. Democratic votes were held, and
					the majority got their will. China seemed rather exotic and
					suitable for most of us, and no one in the group had ever been
					there before. After agreeing on China, we decided the two main
					“bases”: Shanghai and Beijing. Shanghai is known to be representing
					the modern and technological part of China, while Beijing’s main
					focus lies in presenting Chinese history and traditions. The
					planning process could begin!
